A Brief Introduction
======================

My primary goal was to research popular movies vocabulary â€“ words all those heroes actually saying to us and put well known movies onto the scale from the ones with the widest lexicon down to below average range despite possible crowning by IMDB rating, Box Office revenue or number / lack of Academy Awards.Main unit of analysis is Number of unique words per 1000 which says about how WIDE the vocabulary of each movie / TV show is. I saw and personally made similar analysis for literature, music or web content but never for real top movies texts, not scripts.This post is the 2nd Part of the Movies text analysis and covers analysis itself and displaying results in nice looking tables using gt package.
